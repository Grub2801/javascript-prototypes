# JavaScript Prototypes LAB

You are going to take over the Javascript world with a new army of Soldier objects.

- Create a new `soldier` constructor function that allows you to create soldiers
- A `soldier` should be able to have a `name` and `number`
- The default type of a solder should be `footsoldier`
- The `soldier`'s `number` should sequentially increase
- Each `soldier` in the army should have the same `battleCry`, an alert of **"FREEDOM!"**
- Your `army` should have a general, and who's type is `general`
- Your `general`'s `number` should be incremented inline with your `footsolders`

Happy Coding!!
